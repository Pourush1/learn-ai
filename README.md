# Learn AI Engineering

A comprehensive, curated collection of the best resources to master AI/ML, Large Language Models, and AI Agents. This repository brings together high-quality learning materials from across the web - from foundational mathematics to cutting-edge AI applications.

## About This Collection

This is a **resource hub** featuring learning materials that have been recommended by AI practitioners, researchers, and educators. While I haven't personally completed every single resource listed here, each one has been chosen based on:

- **Community reputation** and positive feedback
- **Quality of content** and teaching methodology
- **Relevance** to modern AI engineering practices
- **Accessibility** for learners at different levels

Whether you're a complete beginner starting your AI journey or an experienced developer looking to specialize in LLMs and AI agents, you'll find valuable resources here to guide your learning path.

## 🧠 Understanding the AI Ecosystem

To effectively navigate your AI learning journey, it's helpful to understand how the current AI landscape is structured. The ecosystem can be divided into three key categories:

### 1. **AI Product Companies**

**What they do**: Build end-user applications and services powered by AI

- **Examples**: ChatGPT interfaces, AI writing assistants, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles. Eg: Preplexity, replit, Cursor, Notion, Coda, Figma
- **Skills needed**: Product development, UX/UI, API integration, prompt engineering
- **Career path**: Often the entry point for software engineers transitioning into AI

### 2. **AI Infrastructure Companies**

**What they do**: Create tools, platforms, and services that help AI product companies build and deploy AI solutions

- **Examples**: Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate), LLM orchestration (LangChain), MLOps platforms (Weights & Biases), cloud AI services (AWS Bedrock), Together.ai, Hugging Face
- **Skills needed**: System design, DevOps, cloud architecture, AI tooling
- **Career path**: Natural progression for engineers wanting to work closer to the AI stack

### 3. **AI Model Provider Companies**

**What they do**: Research, develop, and provide the foundational AI models that power the entire ecosystem

- **Examples**: OpenAI (GPT models), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), Meta (Llama), Stability AI (Stable Diffusion)
- **Skills needed**: Deep learning research, model training, distributed systems, GPU optimization
- **Career path**: Requires deep technical expertise in ML/AI fundamentals

### 🎯 **Choosing Your Learning Path**

**Most common progression for software engineers:**

1. **Start here** → AI Product Companies (learn to _use_ AI effectively)
2. **Then advance** → AI Infrastructure Companies (learn to _enable_ AI at scale)
3. **Finally specialize** → AI Model Providers (learn to _create_ the core AI intelligence)

**💡 Pro Tip**: This learning resource is designed to support all three paths, with early phases focusing on foundational skills needed across all categories, and later phases diving into specializations.

## 🚀 How to Use This Guide

1. **Start with the basics** - Mathematical foundations and Python if you're new
2. **Follow your interests** - Use the icons to find your preferred learning format
3. **Build projects** - Apply what you learn with hands-on practice
4. **Stay updated** - AI moves fast, so keep learning continuously

> 💡 **Tip**: Don't try to consume everything at once. Pick a learning path that matches your goals and current skill level.
